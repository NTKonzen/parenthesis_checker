This project is a simple tool for checking the validity of parentheses in a given string. It provides two methods of usage: one using React and npm, and the other using Node.js.

## React Method (via npm start)

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
5. Run `npm start` to start the React development server.
6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
7. Enter a string containing parentheses into the input field.
8. Click the "Check" button to validate the parentheses.

## Node Method (via node nodeJsVersion.js [string here])

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Open the `nodeJsVersion.js` file in a text editor.
5. Replace `[string here]` in the command with the string you want to check.
6. Run the command `node nodeJsVersion.js [string here]` in your terminal.
7. The program will output whether the parentheses in the string are valid or not.

That's it! You can now use the Parenthesis Checker to verify the correctness of parentheses in your strings.
