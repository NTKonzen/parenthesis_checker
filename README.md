# Parenthesis Checker

> This README, although heavily modified, was generated by GitHub Copilot AI. Check commit history for original AI version and all handmade changes.

This project is a simple tool for checking the validity of parentheses pairs in a given string. It provides two methods of usage: one using React, and the other using Node.js.

This project was developed on macOS 14.6.1 (Sonoma)

## React Method

> This project was hastily built and therefore primarily optimized for Chrome. Performance on other browsers may vary.

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
5. Run `npm start` to start the React development server.
6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
7. Enter a string containing parentheses into the input field.
8. Press Enter or hit Submit button to add valid strings to the output box (invalid strings will be denied)

## Node.js Method

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the command `node nodeJsVersion.js [string here]` in your terminal, replacing `[string here]` with your parenthesis string (e.g. `([]){}`)
5. The program will print whether the parentheses in the string are valid or not.

## Examples

### Valid Strings

- `((((()))))`
- `([{}])`
- `{[]()}`
- `()[{}]`

### Invalid Strings

- `(()`
- `[}`
- `}`
- `(`
- `([)]`

## ToDo

- [ ] Add automated tests
- [ ] UI: make card styling more robust when resizing page
